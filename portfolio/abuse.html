                    <h3>HAYOP discourages people from causing excessive and unethical harm to the animals whether they own them or not. No human should be cruel to these animals whether domestic or household. They should also not be neglected. They are living creatures like us who have basic needs that we must help fulfill in order for them to survive. Some common types of animals abuse are:</h3>

                    <p>Leashing of animals must be handled with utmost care. Be sure to be attentive and assertive of what kind of collar and chains or ropes to use and how to leash animals properly. You can see marks in their neck if they were tied up a long time which calls for at least freeing them even for a short time. Also if their chain or ropes are short they can be strangled. Also some pet owners don’t change their water or clean their cages making their pets ill. We must prevent this from happening because like us animals have life that we must cherish.</p>

                    <h1 style="text-align:center">Animal Negligence</h1>
                    <p>Like us humans, animals also have their basic needs. To survive, animals need food, water, and shelter. There are a lot of homeless animals or unwanted that are eating anything they'll see even it's unhealthy to them, which might cause them a variety of health problems. Some pet owners don't feed them; don't give water and proper shelter. It’s important for animals have the right balance of essential vitamins, nutrients and minerals for their bodies to function properly. So if you are a person who has or is thinking of having a pet, it is essential that you consider these factors. If there are stray pets wondering around, be sure to call the animal control agency so that they may aid these animals and provide them with the basic needs that none of the pedestrians encountering them can give.</p>

                    <h1 style="text-align:center">Improper Feeding</h1>
                    <p>You can't just feed an animal with any kind of food. A good example of this is a dog; a dog can't eat chocolate because there is a chemical content in chocolate is considered poison to them. Feed your pet or any other animal the correct kind of food to keep them healthy. Not feeding your animal too is dangerous for the obvious reason that they will starve to death, for the worst-case scenario. Other scenario would be them scavenging for leftovers inside trash bins, which would be considered dangerous because there is a chance that these will contain bacteria that can destroy an animal’s digestive system, leading to other more serious sickness.</p>

                    <h1 style="text-align:center">Animal Violence</h1>
                    <p>Animals such as rhinos and elephants are being hunted for their horns that can be used to obtain ivory. This kind of trade is mostly illegal due to potential extinction of these animals, particularly in Africa. Not only that, certain skin and fur of animals are very precious to hunters which leads them to perform a hunting spree to obtain these. Violence and prolonging it will threaten the population of these animals and will certainly lead to extinction, as well as affecting the cycle of the whole food chain of wildlife. For the household animals, breeds of fierce dogs especially bulldogs are being trained into dogfighting. For the entertainment of the audience of such shows which almost always involved gambling, these dogs are forced to fight and eat each other to death. However, the most common violence that involves dogs is the known cooking and eating of them, especially the stray ones.</p>
