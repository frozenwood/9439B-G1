Not providing basic needs 

To survive, animals need food, water, and shelter. 
There are a lot of homeless animals or unwanted that are eating anything they'll see even it's unhealthy to them, 
which might cause them a variety of health problems. 
Some pet owners don't feed them, don't give water and proper shelter. 
Itâ€™s important for animals have the right balance of essential vitamins, 
nutrients and minerals for their bodies to function properly. 
Like us humans, animals also have their basic needs and a right to live
